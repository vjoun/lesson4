            <p>Hello, I am Vida. I do freelancing full time.
              Anything with PHP, Javascript, MySQL, HTML5 and Css excites me.
              Over the years I have created a variety of applications using these technologies.
              Waiting to work with you!.</p>
            <p>Portfolio is partly based on the Latin folium, meaning "leaf, sheet".
              A portfolio usually represents a portable showcase of your talents.
              Today <a href="#">actual portfolios</a> are used less than they used to be by artists,
              since most commercial artists have a website dedicated to showing off their art.
              But portfolio in its other common meaning is extremely common.</p>
